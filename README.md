# UMass-OSTK
UMass OpenSim ToolKit is a specialized tool kit for using SimTK OpenSim to process recorded biomechanics data. 

This tool kit is intended to help process biomechanics data of amputee locomotion. It includes generic transtibial amputee models with a passive prosthesis and active experimental robotic prosthesis, and functions for data processing via a MATLAB API. 

To run the example, you must first have OpenSim 3.3 installed with the MATLAB API, download the UMass-OSTK and add the functions folder to the MATLAB path. The last step can be done by running "pathtool" in the MATLAB command window. Unzip DataProcessingExample.zip to a local working directory, and set the MATLAB parent working directory to this location. You can then work through 3 .m scripts in the example that show how to process data with the tool kit.
